               <p>After getting my Associates degree from Darton College in 1996, I moved to Atlanta to start Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU).  
               I began taking classes during the day while working nights and weekends pushing carts at the local Sam&#39;s Club.  
               After busting my butt for several months in what turned out to be one of Atlanta&#39;s worst winters on record, I found an ad for an 
               overnight computer operator job in the financial aid department at SPSU.
               </p>

               <p>I continued my education until I decided I wanted to move out of off-campus housing and got myself into debt 
                 by purchasing a new vehicle (worst decision ever).  
                 I then decided to take a semester off to catch up with some mounting debts.  
                 That one semester ended up being more like 5 years long.</p>

               <p>I was always interested in programming, but I couldn&#39;t seem to land any entry level programming jobs or internships without a college degree.  
               I ended up trying many different fields and attained a few certifications.  
               I worked in QA, computer repairs, help desk, systems implementations, and network engineering.  
               Even during these different jobs, I still worked on the side learning scripting languages and a little programming where ever I could.</p>

               <p>I knew I wanted to go back to finish college and an unfortunate lay-off ended up putting me in a help desk job in downtown Atlanta, 
               right next to Georgia State University.  I wanted to go back to SPSU, but the proximity of GSU made it very easy for me to 
               finish my degree quickly, while working full time.</p>

               <p>I was working on contract (co-op) at Georgia Pacific when I finished my degree in 2006.  Almost ten years after I started my degree, but I was finally done.  
               Luckily for me, the market was starting to recover from the tech bubble and hadn&#39;t quite made it to the housing bubble yet, 
               so I started a contract at Blue Linx and that is where my career began.</p>
